# Scrapbook

Scrapbook is meant as a memory database for families affected by Alzheimer's. Active recall has proven to be helpful in slowing/improving the progress of the disease, so Scrapbook was created in the hopes that those afflicted would be able to look at their memories and, well, recall them.
